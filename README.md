**Note:** Calendar to follow, but we're aiming to go live on every third Thursday of each month at 11 AM PT.

On Code Corner, we cover topics pertaining to developers at different points in their coding journeys. In Beginner's Corner we cover coding fundamentals in an assortment of different programming languages for those just getting started. And in Project Corner we show more in-depth projects using AWS services, again in different languages, for those who are further along in their knowledge.

You've found where we store all our projects!
